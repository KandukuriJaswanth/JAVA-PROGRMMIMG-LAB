Task-1(c)
c)	Write a java program that implements the method overloading.
Aim: To write a java program that implements the method overloading.
Description:
1.	Method overloading is a feature of java   in which a class has more than one method of the same name and their parameters are different.
2.	Method overloading can be done by changing number of arguments or by changing the data type of argument.
3.	If two or more method have same and same parameter list but differs in return type  can not  be overloading.

Algorithm:
      Step-1:  Start the program.
Step-2:  Create a class A.
Step-3:  create two class methods in class A, one is with parameters and another one is with no parameters which calculate the area.
Step-4:    Create the main method in another method.
Step-5:  Create a new object for class A.
Step-6:  Call two methods in class A by pass parameters if required.
Step-7:   Stop the program.
Program:
 public     class A
 {
        int l=10,b=20;
          int area()
          { 
                return l*b; 
          }
             int area(int l,int b)
               { 
                   return l*b;
               } 
   } 
        class overmethoddemo 
            { 
                   public static void main(String args[])
                    { 
                            A a1=new A();
                             int r1=a1.area(); 
                         System.out.println("The area is: "+r1);
                            int r2=a1.area(5,20); 
                            System.out.println("The area is: "+r2); 
                    }
           }
 Output: 
The area is: 200
 The area is: 100
Result:  Thus , in the above program successfully executed without errors using method overloading.

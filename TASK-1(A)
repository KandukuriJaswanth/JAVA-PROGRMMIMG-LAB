Task-1:A
a)	 Write  a  java programs that implements constructor.
Aim: To write a java program that implements a constructor.
Description: In java is a block of code similar to a method that’s called when an instance of an object is created. A constructor is called automatically 
when a new instance of an object.
Rules for creating java constructor:
1)	Constructor name must be the same as it class name.
2)	A constructor must have no explicit return type.
3)	A java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final and synchronized.
             Algorithm:
Step-1: Start the program.
Step-2: Declare the class as an example with variables.
Step-3: Declare the constructor declaration in class.
Step-4: Define constructor definition outside class with variable initialization.
Step-5: Stop.

Program:
       public class Box
          {
    double width;
    double height;
   double  depth;
   Box(double w, double h, double d)
   {
      width = w;
      height = h;
      depth =  d; 
   } 
    double volume()
     {
        return width*height*depth;
     }
}
   class constructor
    {
       public static void main(String args[])
         {
             Box mybox1= new Box(10,50,20);
               double vol;
               vol = mybox1.volume();
              System.out.println(“volume is “+vol);
          }
   }
     Output:
       Volume is:1000  
Result:     Thus, in the above program successfully executed without errors using    constructor
